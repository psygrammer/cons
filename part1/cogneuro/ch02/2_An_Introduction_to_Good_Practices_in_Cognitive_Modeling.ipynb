    "    - testing selective influence of experimental manipulations on model parameters, \n",
    "    - quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates, \n",

    "* One of the central challenges for the study of the human mind is that cognitive processes cannot be directly observed.\n",
    "* Another challenge, one that exacerbates the first, is that task performance is often the end result of an unknown combination of several different cognitive processes.\n",
    "* Observed task performance needs to be decomposed in terms of the separate contributions of relevant cognitive processes. Such decomposition almost always requires the use of a cognitive process model.\n",
